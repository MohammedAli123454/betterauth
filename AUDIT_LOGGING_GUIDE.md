# Audit Logging System - Complete Guide

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema**
- Created `audit_log` table with the following fields:
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `userId`: Who performed the action
  - `action`: What action was performed (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)
  - `resource`: What resource was affected (employee, user, system)
  - `resourceId`: ID of the affected resource
  - `details`: JSON string with additional details
  - `ipAddress`: IP address of the user
  - `userAgent`: Browser/device information
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp of the action

### 2. **Audit Logger Utility** (`/lib/audit-logger.ts`)
Provides helper functions for logging:
- `logEmployeeCreate()` - Log employee creation
- `logEmployeeUpdate()` - Log employee updates
- `logEmployeeDelete()` - Log employee deletion
- `logUserRoleChange()` - Log role changes
- `logUserBan()` - Log user bans/unbans
- `logDataExport()` - Log data exports

### 3. **Automatic Logging on Employee Operations**
All employee CRUD operations now automatically log:
- ✅ **Create**: Logs who created, what data, from which IP
- ✅ **Update**: Logs what fields changed (old → new values)
- ✅ **Delete**: Logs who deleted, employee details

### 4. **Audit Logs Viewing Page** (`/audit-logs`)
**Admin-only page** with:
- 📊 Real-time activity log
- 🔍 Advanced filters (action, resource, date range, search)
- 📄 Pagination (20 records per page)
- 📥 Export to CSV
- 🎨 Color-coded action badges
- 📱 Responsive design

### 5. **Audit Logs API** (`/api/audit-logs`)
- **GET**: Fetch audit logs with filters and pagination
- **GET /export**: Export audit logs to CSV

## 🚀 How to Use

### Viewing Audit Logs

1. **Login as Admin**
2. **Click "Audit Logs"** in the sidebar
3. **View all activities** tracked in the system

### Filtering Logs

Use the filters to narrow down results:
- **Action**: Filter by specific actions (Create, Update, Delete, etc.)
- **Resource**: Filter by resource type (Employee, User, System)
- **Search**: Search across actions, resources, IDs
- **Date Range**: Filter by start and end date

### Exporting Logs

1. Apply filters (optional)
2. Click **"Export to CSV"** button
3. CSV file downloads automatically
4. The export action is also logged!

## 📊 What Gets Logged

### Employee Actions
| Action | What's Logged | Who Can Do It |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Create | Name, email, position, department, IP, timestamp | Admin, Super User |
| Update | Changed fields (old → new values), IP, timestamp | Admin only |
| Delete | Employee name, email, IP, timestamp | Admin only |

### Example Log Entry (Employee Create)
```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "userId": "user_xyz",
  "action": "EMPLOYEE_CREATE",
  "resource": "employee",
  "resourceId": "emp_456",
  "details": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "position": "Developer",
    "department": "Engineering"
  },
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-08T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

### GDPR Compliance
- ✅ Tracks who accessed/modified personal data
- ✅ Provides audit trail for data subject requests
- ✅ Logs data exports

### SOC 2 Compliance
- ✅ Comprehensive activity logging
- ✅ Admin action tracking
- ✅ IP address and timestamp recording
- ✅ Tamper-proof logs (no deletion endpoint)

### Features for Accountability
- **Who**: User name and email
- **What**: Specific action and resource
- **When**: Precise timestamp
- **Where**: IP address
- **How**: User agent (device/browser)
- **Details**: What exactly changed

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### Created:
1. `/db/schema.ts` - Added `auditLog` table schema
2. `/lib/audit-logger.ts` - Audit logging utilities
3. `/app/api/audit-logs/route.ts` - API for fetching logs
4. `/app/api/audit-logs/export/route.ts` - CSV export API
5. `/app/audit-logs/page.tsx` - Audit logs viewing page
6. `/scripts/add-audit-log-table.ts` - Migration script

   - Your name as the user
   - Employee details
   - Your IP address
   - Timestamp

### Test 2: Update Employee
1. Edit an existing employee
2. Change name from "John" to "Jane"
3. Check audit logs
4. You should see `EMPLOYEE_UPDATE` with:
   - `details.name.old: "John"`
   - `details.name.new: "Jane"`

### Test 3: Delete Employee
1. Delete an employee
2. Check audit logs
3. You should see `EMPLOYEE_DELETE` with employee's name and email

### Test 4: Export Logs
1. Go to `/audit-logs`
2. Click "Export to CSV"
3. CSV file downloads
4. Check audit logs - the export itself is logged!

## 🎨 UI Features

### Color-Coded Actions
- 🟢 **Green**: CREATE actions
- 🔵 **Blue**: UPDATE actions
- 🔴 **Red**: DELETE actions
- 🟣 **Purple**: LOGIN/LOGOUT actions
- ⚪ **Gray**: Other actions

### Expandable Details
Click "View Details" on any log entry to see:
- Complete change history
- JSON-formatted details
- All tracked information

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Indexes Created
For fast querying:
- `userId` index - Fast filtering by user
- `resource` index - Fast filtering by resource type
- `createdAt` index - Fast date range queries

### Pagination
- Shows 20 logs per page
- Total count displayed
- Previous/Next navigation

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
1. **User Activity Dashboard** - Graphs and charts
2. **Real-time Notifications** - Alert on suspicious activity
3. **Log Retention Policy** - Auto-archive old logs
4. **Advanced Analytics** - Most active users, peak times
5. **Audit Log Search** - Full-text search
6. **Admin Action Logging** - Log role changes, bans
7. **Email Alerts** - Notify admins of critical actions

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Logs Not Appearing?
1. Check if you're logged in as admin
2. Verify database connection
3. Check browser console for errors

### Export Not Working?
1. Ensure you have audit logs to export
2. Check browser pop-up blocker
3. Verify admin permissions

### Details Not Showing?
1. Click "View Details" to expand
2. Check if `details` field has data
3. Verify JSON formatting

## 📚 Code Examples

### Manually Log an Action
```typescript
import { createAuditLog, AuditAction, AuditResource } from '@/lib/audit-logger';

await createAuditLog({
  userId: session.user.id,
  action: AuditAction.EMPLOYEE_CREATE,
  resource: AuditResource.EMPLOYEE,
  resourceId: employee.id,
  details: { name: 'John Doe' },
  ipAddress: getIpFromRequest(request),
  userAgent: getUserAgentFromRequest(request),
});
```

### Query Audit Logs Programmatically
```typescript
import { db } from '@/db';
import { auditLog } from '@/db/schema';
import { eq } from 'drizzle-orm';

const logs = await db
  .select()
  .from(auditLog)
  .where(eq(auditLog.userId, userId))
  .limit(10);
```

- ✅ Export audit logs to CSV
- ✅ GDPR & SOC2 compliance ready
- ✅ Admin-only access
